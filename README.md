  <summary>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python</summary>
  - I've enjoyed using it to date and feel that its creator and the Python community have done a good job at keeping the ecosystem organized and sane.
  - It sounds trivial but it isn't: the lack of brackets really reduces visual noise and makes code a good chunk easier to read, it really does.
  - The list slicing and comprehension syntax is complex and terse but delivers big rewards once you begin to remember the various rules.
  - One area I need to freshen up on is Multiprocessing. The last time I read about it, the GIL was the big problem, meaning that whilst multithreading was possible, multiprocessing was not as you were effectively limited to 1 process.
