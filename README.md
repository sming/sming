# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Pete, and I'm a seasoned backend/full-stack engineer who's added real value to teams and projects of all shapes and sizes, using many different languages and technologies!

  <summary>ðŸ”Ž My Ideal Job</summary>

  - I was finally let go by Classkick along with a few others after surviving 4 or 5 "reduction in force"'s and hence I am on the looking for something rewarding, stimulating and fun (where possible!) that ideally leaves the World in a better place, even if just a little.
  - Three Seed/A-Series companies I've recently worked for have struggled financially and so I'm looking for more financial stability this time: a more mature Start-Up or a fully fledged company.
  - In terms of role or position, I like to be the "right hand man" of the team lead or PM. A senior individual contributor who's able to tackle chunky projects, mentor more junior staff, architect subsystems and so on. I am not a team leader, nor a Project Manager ðŸ˜„

  <summary>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python</summary>

  - I've enjoyed using it to date and feel that its creator and the Python community have done a good job at keeping the ecosystem organized and sane.
  - It sounds trivial but it isn't: the lack of brackets really reduces visual noise and makes code a good chunk easier to read, it really does.
  - The list slicing and comprehension syntax is complex and terse but delivers big rewards once you begin to remember the various rules.
  - One area I need to freshen up on is Multiprocessing. The last time I read about it, the GIL was the big problem, meaning that whilst multithreading was possible, multiprocessing was not as you were effectively limited to 1 process.
